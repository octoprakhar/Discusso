# Discusso : Where conversations find a home.

## Project Requirements

**Discusso** is a social community platfor inspired by Reddit. It enables users to share posts, join discussions, and explore communities. The platform also integrates ML/DL features(in later phases) for personalized recommendations, semantic search, and content moderation.

## Core Features

### Authentication & User Management

    1. User Registration & Login
        - New users register with email + password
        - Login with valid credentials
        - Sessions are persisted(user stays logged in unless explicitly signed out)
    2. Session Handling
        - If already logged in, redirect to home(skip login page).
        - Secure session management with JWT cookies.
    3. Profile Management
        - Update profile(username, avatar).
        - Manage drafts (saved posts).
        - Change email & password.
        - View karma (upvotes - downvotes).

### Communities

    1. Create Communities
        - Users with >= **50 karma** and joined >= **50 days ago** can create a community.
        - Communities prefixed with "d/"(like d/technology).
    2. Explore Communities
        - An Explore tab shows recommended communities (via ML recommendations).
        - Users can search communities using (d/<name>).

### Posts & Feeds

    1. Create Posts
        - Fields:
            * Community name (d/community)
            * Title (required)
            * Body (optional, formatted with Markdown-style editor: bold, italic, code, blocks, images)
            * Tags (Mature, Spoiler, Affiliate, None)
            * Attachments: Images/videos
        - Options: **Publish** or **Save as Draft**.
        - User can save upto 20 drafts.
        - They will be shown and opened through button of profile dropdown. Initially we can't save media files and links in draft.
    2. Feed System
        - Home Feed: posts from joined communities.
        - Popular Feed: top upvoted posts site-wide.
        - Explore Feed: recommened posts/communities (ML-powered).
    3. Post Interactions
        - Upvote/Downvote (affects karrma).
        - Share (copy link)
        - Comment + reply.
        - Bookmark/save for later.

### Search

    1. Search by:
        - Community (d/xyz)
        - Post title or description
    2. (Future ML Feature) **Semantic Search** -> FInd posts by meaning, not just keywords.

### Gamification (Karma System)

    1. Karma - Total upvotes - downvotes
    2. Karma unlocks features (like community creation).
    3. Visible in user profile.

## Planned ML/DL Features (Phase 2)

    1. Personalized Feed -> Recommend posts based on user behavior.
    2. Toxicity Detection -> Flag/report offensive comments using NLP.
    3. Auto-Tagging -> NLP to generate suggested tags for new posts.
    4. Semantic Search -> Use embeddings for meaning-based search
    5. Trend Prediction -> Early prediction of which posts will become popular.

## App Flow

    1. Guest User
        - Can Browse public posts.
        - Can search communities/posts.
        - Redirected to login when trying to upvote/comment/create.

    2. Authenticated User
        - Access home feed, communities, and profile.
        - Create posts/draft.
        - Vote, comment, share, and save posts.
        - Eligible to create communities if requirements met.

    3. Admin/Moderator (Future)
        - Manage flagged posts/comments
        - Community moderation (ban usrs, approve posts).

## Tech Stack

    - **Frontend & Backend**: Next.js + TailwindCSS
    - **Database**: Supabase(Postgres)

## Database Design Overview

The database is divided into two categories:

- **Pure Database Tables** → store main entities (users, posts, comments, etc.)
- **Interaction Tables** → store user interactions (votes, joins, etc.)

Below is the high-level schema visualization:

### Pure database entities overview:

1. **User**: It will consist of

```
{
    id:Int, //userId (Primary Key)
    createdAt:Date_time, //When this user joined discusso
    userName: String,
    email: String,
    password: String,
    Gender: String?,
    DisplayName: String?,
    userIcon: String?, //Profile photo of a user
    userLocation: String/JSON, //Not decided whether to store json or string. I mean whether to store lat-lang or normal address.
}

```

2. **Community**:

```
{
    id: Int, //Primary Key
    createdAt: DateTime,
    creatorId: Int, //(Foreign Key to user Table) which user founded this community
    name: STring,
    logo: String?,
    title: String,
    description: String?
}
```

3. **Post**:

```
{
    id: Int, //(Primary Key)
    createdAt: DateTime,
    communityId: Int, //(Foreign Key) this post is of which community
    userId: Int, //(Foreign Key to user Table) which user created this post
    title: String,
    description: String?,
      media JSONB, -- e.g. { "images": [...], "video": "url", "links": [...] }
// First version of my app won't fully support video till now. It may get broken!!!
}
```

4. **Comments**:

```
{
    id: Int, //(Primary Key)
    createdAt:DateTime,
    postId: Int, //(Foreign key to post table) This comment is on which post
    userId: Int, //(Foreign key to user table) This comment is done by which user
    parentCommentId: Int?, //Is it a direct comment to post, or is it a reply to another comment.
    content: String
}
```

5. **Draft**: **A user can't have more than 10 drafts**. In the first version of my app, it is not supporting to save media or links in draft

```
{
    id: Int, //(Primary key)
    lastEditedAt: Date_time,
    userId: Int, //(Foreign key to user table) which user's draft is this
    selectedCommunityId: Int?, //(Foreign key to community table) does user before saving to draft selected any community to do the post?
    title: String,
    body: String?
}
```

### Interaction database entities overview:

1. **CommunityInteraction** : In the first version of app, only interaction between a user and an existing community is a user can join a community or leave it. In upcoming versions improvement whill be there.

{
id: Int, //(Primary Key)
joinedAt: Date_time, // when user joined this community
communityId: Int, //(Foreign Key to community table)
userId: Int, // (Foreign key to user table)
isMember: Boolean, //Default True
}

2. **PostInteraction**: User whenther upvoted or downvoted a post. If there is 1 in upvote column that means user has upvoted and -1 means user has not upvoted and same for downvote.

```
{
    id: Int,// (PK)
    lastUpdatedAt:Date_time, //Last updation of this interaction
    postId: Int, //(FK to post database)
    userId: Int, //(FK to user table)
    vote: Int //Either 1 for upvote and -1 for downvote

}
```

3. **CommentInteraction**: Same as PostInteraction table.

```
{
    id: INt,//PK
    lastUpdatedAt: Date_Time,
    commentId: Int, //(FK to comments table)
    userId: Int, //(FK to user table)
    vote: Int //Either 1 for upvote and -1 for downvote
}
```
